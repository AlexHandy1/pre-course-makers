PreCourse Week 3
================

Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* Importance of being comfortable working with and iterating over strings, arrays and hashes - focused on drilling this 
* Stepping away from problem can help you come back at it in a new way - helped when getting frustrated with challenges
* Stick to a method - break every problem down into key steps and can much more effectively tailor specific problems that you need to research

Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* Recursion - conceptually clear but current finding challenging to identify and implement
* Blocs, Procs and Lamdas - particularly when used in more complex situations when combined with certain method parameters
* Self - understand what it does but still not 100% clear on key use cases for it


Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* Looking forward to working with other people on a daily basis - challenges and frustrations of primarily working solo reinforcing why decided to do a full-time course

Other Experiences This Week:
-------------------------------

* First time fully appreciated magnitude of content to learn and got properly stuck! Excited to get into things full-time
