PreCourse Week 2
================

Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* For Git focus on the HEAD (where you are), the origin (the remote linked to) and the master (the original branch) to get bearings
* Branching, rebasing, merging, forking and pull requests as key tools to manage real development projects

Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* Resolving some of the more complex issues in Git/ Github
	- Submodules (minor # of files not being tracked)
	- accessing files on GitHub that recursively copied over or sit in multiple repositories (e.g. Octocat)
	- Different remote access/ management across layers in a directory
	- Uses for multiple tracking remotes
* Using git revert and git reset efficiently


Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* Do some proper pair programming now that I am writing larger programmes in Ruby
* Try out writing a git hook script in ruby and further explore advanced git tools (e.g. submodules) to keep progressing


Other Experiences This Week:
-------------------------------

* Need to resist temptation of rushing ahead to next thing and make sure fully understand and can use existing knowledge
