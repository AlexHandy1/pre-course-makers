PreCourse Week 4
================

Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* Drilling stuff you are uncomfortable with works - much more confident on working with arrays, hashes, strings etc after Codewars
* Regular expressions, inject and using arrays with &blocks can half the amount of code you need to write

Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* Multiple ways that can use procs, blocks and lambdas around and within method parameters still confuses me
* Need to work more with rspec and TDD approaches - feels very different to how I have been approaching problems when I work through some of the rspec problems/ tutorials 


Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* Need to be pair programming and working with others now
* Building on focusing application of things learn on actual side-projects, helps with frustrations


Other Experiences This Week:
-------------------------------

* Enjoyed setting up the blog and getting back into HTML and CSS
