PreCourse Week 1
================

Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* Importance of trying to solve something thoroughly (beyond just basic googling) yourself first - can get further than you think
* PATH, pipes/ redirecting and other env variables are key for how whole computer works

Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* Even something seemingly straight forward (e.g. Git clone/ update) can take a significant amount of time to set-up
* Practically implementing things outside tutorials/ clear steps to follow


Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* Do some pair programming/ meet mentor
* Experiment more with concepts/ things that learn outside of tutorials and exercises


Other Experiences This Week:
-------------------------------

* Its great when you actually figure something out on your own
